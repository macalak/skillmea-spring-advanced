# Application events
The event publishing is provided by ApplicationContext. Springâ€™s eventing mechanism is designed for simple communication 
between Spring beans within the same application context. It is implementation of the Observer pattern.
Spring handles either custom event classes which extends the ApplicationEvent, or any arbitrary classes. 

# Build-in events

* ContextRefreshedEvent

* ContextStoppedEvent
